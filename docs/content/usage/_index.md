Make sure that `ilo` is [installed](./install) in your PATH or otherwise accessible from your terminal. The following subcommands are currently available:

## ilo shell

The `ilo shell` command can be used to run a single container either in interactive mode (default) or non-interactive mode (e.g. for CI builds).

```console
[you@hostname project-dir]$ ilo shell
[root@container project-dir]#
```

Take a look at more detailed information [here](../shell).
