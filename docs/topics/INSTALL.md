In case you want to help package `ilo` for your preferred operating system, take a look at the [open packaging issues](tbd).

## Package Types

This package requires a Java 11 runtime installed on the host machine.
It uses the identifier `java11`.

## Installation Methods

### Manual Command Line (Mac/Linux)

```shell script
$ export ILO_VERSION={release-version}
$ export ILO_TYPE=java11
$ cd /path/to/ilo/installation/folder
$ curl --location https://github.com/metio/ilo/releases/download/${ILO_VERSION}/ilo-${ILO_VERSION}-${ILO_TYPE}.zip --output ilo.zip

## CLI Autocomplete

In order to get autocomplete working in your shell, run the following after installing `ilo`:

```shell script
$ source <(ilo generate-completion)
```

Place the same line in your `.bashrc` (or similar) file in order to make the change permanent.

### Oh-My-Zsh

[OMZ](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) uses the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` directory in order to customize your shell.
In order to integrate the autocomplete support, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in `$ZSH_CUSTOM`, e.g. `$ZSH_CUSTOM/ilo.sh`.
2. Use the following template
    ```shell script
    $ source <(ilo generate-completion)
    ```

3. Reload your shell (or create a new one)
